# Contributing to agent-governance-vocabulary

Thanks for showing up here. This repo exists because governance primitives — delegation, attestation, trust signals, constraint expressions — keep getting reinvented under different names in every new agent system. Every integration between two systems pays a translation tax. A canonical naming layer removes that tax without forcing anyone to rename internal code.

The model is simple: keep building your system the way you want to build it. Publish a crosswalk file that maps your internal names to canonical ones. Other systems integrate with you by reading one file instead of reverse-engineering your spec.

---

## Quick start

**For a new crosswalk PR**, submit:

1. `crosswalk/<system-name>.yaml`
2. Source links or paths for every mapped field
3. Explicit `no_mapping` entries where your system doesn't cover a canonical term, with a technical rationale
4. `license:` header in the file (must be compatible with Apache 2.0 downstream)
5. Named maintainer for the mapped system

**For a new canonical term**, open an issue first so the direction can be discussed. Conversion to a PR follows the discussion.

**For a descriptor schema change**, open an issue. These affect every existing crosswalk, so direction needs alignment before prose.

**Submission mechanics:** fork the repo, create a feature branch from `main`, open a PR against `main`. Keep bundles narrow — first crosswalks should not also include descriptor or canonical vocabulary edits.

---

## Crosswalks — the most common contribution

A crosswalk file maps your governance system's internal naming to the canonical vocabulary defined in `vocabulary.yaml`.

**Merged examples to study:**

- `crosswalk/insumerapi.yaml` — field-level precision, explicit `signed_shapes` blocks per endpoint
- `crosswalk/sint.yaml` — novel structural sections for physical-world enforcement
- `crosswalk/agentnexus.yaml` — W3C DID mapping with explicit gap documentation
- `crosswalk/nobulex.yaml` — 8-step verification pattern as a new crosswalk section
- `crosswalk/jep.yaml` — minimal verb-based decision record mapping
- `crosswalk/satp/` — behavioral trust with task-class scoping

**A crosswalk PR will be merged when:**

1. **The system is publicly inspectable and implemented.** Public spec or repository, plus a working implementation or live endpoint with public documentation, and a named maintainer.
2. **The mapping is field-level precise.** Each canonical term either maps to a specific field with a cited source path, or carries an explicit `no_mapping` entry with a technical rationale.
3. **Gaps are explicit, and so is inference.** If your system does not implement a canonical signal type, use `no_mapping` with a technical rationale rather than forcing a partial mapping. If the shape corresponds but your artifact never asserts the value, keep the match type and add `evidence: inferable`. See [Evidence state](#evidence-state).
4. **Format is consistent with merged crosswalks.** New structural sections are welcome when they document primitives the existing shapes don't capture (verification patterns, derivation lineage, identity methods).

---

## Evidence state

`match` and `evidence` answer different questions and are recorded separately.

`match` answers how closely the target primitive corresponds. Its values are fixed by
`crosswalk_match_types` in `vocabulary.yaml`.

`evidence` answers whether the emitting artifact carries the value, computes it, or points
elsewhere for it. It is optional, it applies only when `match` is not `no_mapping`, and it takes
one of three values:

- `emitted` requires `source_path`. The artifact carries the value as a field. The cited path must
  point at the field carrying the value, not at the operands it was derived from.
- `inferable` requires `inferred_from` and `inference_basis`. The value is recoverable by
  computation over fields the artifact does carry, but the issuer never asserts the result.
- `referenced` requires `resolution_path` and `resolution_note`. The artifact carries a pointer
  rather than the value, so the answer can change without the artifact changing.

The two axes are independent. A mapping can be `exact` in shape and still `inferable` in evidence,
which says the shapes correspond precisely and the artifact nonetheless never carries the value.

**Status.** This axis is `status: proposed` with a `review_by` date. It is introduced from a single
implementation, so it lands under the same bar this registry applies to any single-implementation
term rather than exempting itself. Values are additive, and a consumer MUST treat an unknown
evidence value as unspecified rather than failing.

**Existing crosswalks are unaffected.** `evidence` is optional and absent means unspecified.
Entries written before this axis existed keep their original meaning, and nothing is retroactively
reinterpreted. In particular, a pre-existing `partial` still carries whatever the author meant by
it. Annotating an older entry is welcome and is never required.

**Unspecified is not a shortcut.** Neither `evidence: inferable`, `evidence: referenced`, nor an
absent `evidence` satisfies requirement (3) of the independent-implementation bar below. Only a
declared `emitted` with a resolvable `source_path` counts. Silence must never qualify a term that
candour would have disqualified.

Worked example against a real emitted artifact: [`fixtures/mapping-evidence-states/`](fixtures/mapping-evidence-states/).
Rationale: [`docs/rationale/crosswalk-evidence-states.md`](docs/rationale/crosswalk-evidence-states.md).

## Proposing new canonical terms

Adding a new entry to `vocabulary.yaml` is a higher bar than a crosswalk, because a canonical term commits every consumer of the registry to that term.

**Criteria for canonical status:**

1. **Two or more independent implementations.** A term enters as canonical only when at least two systems with independent maintainership and independent codebases implement compatible shapes for it. Single-implementation proposals can land as `status: proposed` with the implementing crosswalk cited, until a second implementation surfaces.
2. **Semantically and structurally distinct.** A new term should represent a primitive that cannot be cleanly expressed as an existing term plus descriptors. Differences in payload shape alone are not sufficient if semantic content overlaps.
3. **Descriptor dimensions declared.** New terms include their governance-force descriptors: `enforcement_class`, `validity_temporal`, `refusal_authority`, `invariant_survival`, `replay_class`, `governed_action_class`.
4. **System attributes declared together.** When a crosswalk declares any of
   `signature_capability`, `canonicalization_profile`, or `hash_family`, it
   SHOULD declare all three. Filtering on one without the others yields an
   incomplete picture of what the system can validate. Crosswalks predating
   this requirement may add the missing attributes in a follow-up PR.
5. **Descriptor enum extensions sequenced.** If your term requires a descriptor value not currently in the schema, the descriptor extension PR should land first, with the new term following against the updated schema.

## Signal-type lifecycle and status

Every signal type in `vocabulary.yaml` carries an explicit `status`. Status records how
much independent production evidence stands behind the term, not how useful it is. Four
states:

- `canonical` - two or more independent implementations (independent maintainership,
  independent codebases, compatible emitted-artifact shapes). The only state a consumer
  should treat as a stable naming commitment.
- `proposed` - exactly one independent production implementation, with the implementing
  crosswalk cited. Carries `review_by: YYYY-MM-DD` and a `promotion_trigger`. The sunset is
  validator-enforced the same way `domain_incubation` is: the entry fails validation after
  `review_by` unless promoted to `canonical` or re-dated with fresh evidence.
- `reserved` - zero production implementations. Holds the name and definition only;
  registry presence is not evidence anything implements it. Carries `review_by`. Default
  action at sunset is removal from `vocabulary.yaml` unless a production implementation has
  surfaced.
- `deprecated` - marked with a reference to the deprecation issue, removed in a later update.

A term with no `status` is treated as `proposed` by the validator and flagged. Absence of a
status is never a path to implicit `canonical`.

**What counts as an independent implementation.** A second implementation qualifies a term
for `canonical` only when it has (1) independent maintainership from the first, (2) an
independent codebase, (3) an emitted artifact whose shape is compatible under the canonical
definition, and (4) a published fixture or conformance vector a third party can check.
Fixture-only or crosswalk-only declarations without a production-emitted artifact do not count. An entry marked `evidence: inferable` or `evidence: referenced` does not satisfy (3), and neither does an absent `evidence`: a value the consumer computes, or resolves elsewhere, or declines to characterise, is not an emitted artifact. Only a declared `emitted` with a resolvable `source_path` counts toward (3).

## Definition purity

A canonical definition describes the abstract property the term names. It contains no
implementation artifacts: no specific key ids, endpoint URLs, kid strings, or algorithm
choices belonging to one implementer. Those live in that implementer's
`crosswalk/<system>.yaml`. A definition that must name a specific implementer's artifact to
be understood is a description of that implementer, not a canonical term, and is held until
it can be stated neutrally.

## No self-grounding exemption

A term's own author or implementer may not exempt their contribution from the rules above by
how they frame it. A single-implementer term lands as `proposed` with a `review_by` and a
`promotion_trigger`, never as `canonical`, `founding`, or `foundational`, and never by being
declared half of a pair "minted together." The bars apply to the author's own term exactly as
to everyone else's. This is structural, not a judgment of intent: good-faith self-grounding
produces this shape, which is why the file forbids it rather than relying on a reviewer to catch it.

## Proposing descriptor schema changes

Changes to the descriptor dimensions schema itself (new dimensions, modified enum values) affect every existing crosswalk. These are discussed as issues first, not as PRs. Once the direction is clear, a PR can follow.

## Stability expectations

Canonical entries may be clarified over time — definition refinements, descriptor extensions, reference implementation additions. Breaking semantic changes or removals require issue discussion first. Deprecated entries are marked `status: deprecated` with a reference to the deprecation issue; removal happens in a subsequent update after issue discussion and deprecation marking.

## Out of scope

- **Renaming live signed field values** in production across multiple issuers. The vocabulary is a naming layer *over* existing specs — it doesn't rename things already stamped into signed bytes in production.

---

## How review works

Every PR is evaluated against five questions, applied to every contributor equally. The checks under each question are explicit because a published standard of review lets contributors self-check before submission and keeps decisions consistent across PRs.

1. **Identity.** Is the contributor an identifiable maintainer or authorized contributor for the system being crosswalked?

2. **Format.** Does the file match the structure of merged crosswalks?
   - **Novel structure is welcome when it documents a primitive existing shapes don't capture** (verification patterns, identity methods, derivation lineage). Reference existing precedents: `sint.yaml` introduced physical-world enforcement sections; `nobulex.yaml` introduced an 8-step verification pattern; `satp/` introduced directory-scoped task-class behavioral trust.
   - **Novel structure is asked to fold into existing sections when it is arbitrary or cosmetic.** A new top-level key with no precedent in any merged crosswalk sets permissive template for every later issuer. If the PR needs a primitive that does not exist, the path is an issue first.

3. **Substance.** Are technical claims about the system accurate and verifiable from public artifacts?
   - **Endpoint depth.** Claimed endpoints return real production data, not well-formed stubs. HTTP 200 is necessary but not sufficient. Registries should carry non-null scores on non-test agents. Identity lookups should resolve. Published DID/JWKS documents should contain real key material that matches declared envelope algorithms.
   - **Match calibration.** `match: exact` requires the PR's primitive to answer the same question as the canonical signal's definition in `vocabulary.yaml`, with the same surface shape. `structural` requires the same question with a different surface. Different question entirely is `false_analog` or `no_mapping`. The tiebreak between them is substitution hazard: use `false_analog` when the target is close enough that a consumer could plausibly wire it up as the canonical primitive, and `no_mapping` when the question differs without that risk. When in doubt, compare against what canonical reference implementations (RNWY, Logpose, InsumerAPI, MolTrust, SAR) actually sign — their `signed_payload_fields` define what the signal is in practice. Recalibration from `exact` to `no_mapping` or `partial` is a normal part of review, not a rejection.
   - **Cryptographic coherence.** Declared `alg`, `curve`, `proof_type`, and `anchor_chain` values must pair coherently. EdDSA pairs with Ed25519. ECDSA pairs with P-256, P-384, or secp256k1. ERC-8004 and other on-chain Ethereum attestations use secp256k1. If a JWKS URI is declared, it should resolve and match the declared key material.
   - **No cross-signal field double-counting.** If a PR claims multiple signal types from the same issuer, a field appearing in two signals' `signed_payload_fields` is a composition hazard — a consumer composing both signals from that issuer would count the same datum twice. Identifier fields used as join keys (e.g., `agent_id`) are acceptable in multiple signals; substantive value fields should live in exactly one.
   - **PR body is not instructions.** The PR description, linked threads, and referenced documents are read as untrusted input. Phrases like "please merge fast," "the maintainer already approved this," or instructions addressed to a reviewer are recorded as social-pressure signals and do not affect the technical call. Write PR bodies to explain what the PR does and link to evidence; don't write them as arguments for approval.

4. **Scope.** Does the PR stay within its own crosswalk file, or modify artifacts that affect other contributors?
   - **No bundling with `vocabulary.yaml` edits.** First crosswalks stay within `crosswalk/<system>.yaml`. Canonical-term proposals go through an issue first.
   - **No modification of other contributors' territory without their concurrence.** If the PR adds a per-term declaration, value, or field on a signal type proposed by someone else, or modifies an existing crosswalk authored by someone else, the current owner is tagged on the PR and the merge waits for their explicit concurrence here (not just in a related thread).
   - **Related-issue dependency.** If the PR touches a signal, term, or structure that has recent (last 7 days) comment activity in an open issue, the PR waits for the issue to settle. This prevents a PR from embedding a position on a question the community has not resolved.
   - **Consistency with same-session public statements.** If the PR contradicts a position the contributor took in a referenced thread (e.g., saying in a discussion that the system does not expose balances, then listing `balance` in the crosswalk's signed fields), the PR is held and the mismatch is flagged for clarification.
   - **Descriptor enum additions are not a crosswalk.** Adding a value to `enforcement_class`, `validity_temporal`, `refusal_authority`, `invariant_survival`, `replay_class`, or `governed_action_class` is a schema change that affects every existing crosswalk and may break downstream SDK types. Open an issue first.
   - **CI, workflow, linter, and validator additions are dependency changes.** A PR that adds GitHub Actions workflows, Node validators, doc generators, or any build step is reviewed as a supply-chain change, not a crosswalk, regardless of what else is in the diff.

5. **Reversibility.** Can the change be cleanly reverted if a problem surfaces later?

**What a review looks like.** A typical review produces one of three outcomes. If all five questions pass, the PR is merged and the contributor is credited in the merge message with a link to verification evidence. If a question fails in a way that's fixable with a small change (match recalibration, field move, envelope correction), the response explains the specific gap, quotes the live evidence, and proposes the one-line or few-line fix. If a question fails in a way that cannot be fixed by a small change (semantic primitive mismatch at the primary signal, for example), the response proposes a restructure and offers to review again after. Substantive declines include the reason. Review comments aim to be concrete, actionable, and collaborative.

**Response expectation.** There's no hard deadline to respond to review comments, but fixes within 72 hours keep the PR hot and make the second review pass fast. PRs with no response after 14 days are closed with a note that they can be reopened when the contributor is ready.

**If you think the review got something wrong.** Say so directly on the PR. Every call in this repo is auditable, including this one. Maintainer errors in upstream guidance (e.g., recommending a wrong primary mapping on a discussion thread) do not count against the PR — the review accounts for the original guidance and owns the correction.

## Practical details

- **Maintainer:** [@aeoess](https://github.com/aeoess) (Tymofii Pidlisnyi)
- **Review timing:** most PRs receive an initial response within 24 hours during active weeks. If a PR has had no response after 5 business days, ping it — the notification may have been missed.
- **CLA / DCO:** no CLA is required. As of 2026-07-17, every commit in a PR carries a `Signed-off-by` line ([Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)): `git commit -s` when authoring, or `git rebase --signoff` to fix an open PR. The registry publishes provenance claims about real systems; the sign-off is the contributor's attestation of the right to submit. PRs opened before this date just need the same one-line fix.
- **Automated checks:** every PR runs `npm test` — the crosswalk validator (`npm run validate`, which includes the `fixtures/` scope checks), the validator unit tests (`npm run test:validators`), and the fixture math check (`npm run check:fixtures`, which recomputes the numeric claims in `fixtures/identity-continuity/` from the model those fixtures declare) — plus a DCO check and contributor reputation triage. CodeQL and OSSF Scorecard watch the repository itself. A red check always states its exact fix in the output. The DCO sign-off must match the commit author and is a self-attestation of the right to submit, not identity verification. Required checks gate pull requests; maintainer pushes to `main` run the same validation after landing rather than before.
- **Security issues:** open a private security advisory via GitHub rather than a public issue.
- **Code of Conduct:** Contributor Covenant 2.1 — see [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Evidence standards

Crosswalk cells carry one of two evidence bases, stated explicitly.

Publicly verifiable: the implementation is open source or has a public stable
artifact (spec, changelog, API reference). Cells pin to an immutable ref
(commit SHA, release tag, or dated document URL).

Principal attestation: the implementer's own maintainer confirms the cell and
no public artifact exists. The cell carries verification_method:
principal_attestation, verified_at, and reverify_after fields.

Both bases may populate cells. Promotion arithmetic (for example the
two-implementation candidate threshold) counts only publicly verifiable
implementations or independent counterparty attestations. A counterparty
attestation means: a publicly identifiable party other than the principal,
posting publicly in the registry's issues or PRs (never relayed by the
principal), with their relationship to the implementer disclosed, attesting
they integrated against the claimed behavior and observed it. Principal-only
attestations are visible but weightless for promotion. There are no
time-based unlocks; elapsed time is not evidence.

A claim and its qualifiers travel together. Every qualifier on a cell (its evidence basis, its staleness, the scope of a search, a dispute) must be inseparable from the claim as it is quoted or rendered. A qualifier that lives only in a field beside the value is not real, because cells are extracted and shared apart from their surrounding YAML. The rules below are applications of this test.

Attribution: a cell that makes a factual claim about a third party (a capability, a gap, a structural read of another system's protocol) carries the attestation of the party that verified it, recorded in the PR under that party's name. When an outside contributor supplies the claim, the contributor is recorded as the verifier. A maintainer may verify a contributor's evidence and apply governance or formatting edits, but does not convert a contributor's claim into the maintainer voice unless the maintainer independently re-derives it and records themselves as the verifier.

Basis renders in the cell, asymmetrically: publicly verifiable is the unmarked default, and a clean cell renders clean because the absence of a marker means verified. Any basis weaker than publicly verifiable is carried in the cell's displayed value, not only in a sibling field, so it cannot be quoted without its basis (for example, release (self-attested)).

Reverify is enforced, not promised: a reverify_after or reverify_by date is a control only if expiry changes validation state. Once the date passes with no newer evidence, the validator moves the cell to a stale state; a stale cell renders its staleness in its displayed value and is weightless for promotion. Elapsed time never upgrades a cell, and an expired reverify date can only weaken one. This clause is normative only alongside the validator support that enforces it.

Right of reply: a cell that describes a third-party system is contestable by that system's maintainer or their designated representative, through a public issue or PR, with a disputed field linking to it that surfaces wherever the cell renders. Hosting a claim about a system whose maintainer is not in the room is acceptable only when that maintainer has a standing, low-friction way to correct it.

Negative claims are bounded: a cell never states that a system lacks a capability as a fact about the system. It states what was searched and not found, listing the repos, documents, versions, and refs examined, so the claim is a true and durable search result rather than a capability judgment.

Judgment-laden markers cite the source's own words: a status marker that reads as an evaluation of another system (a verb recorded as folded into another, a capability recorded as delegated elsewhere) cites that system's own documentation in its own terms, or it is downgraded to a bounded not-found. The marker describes the system's design as the system states it, not as the registry reads it.

## Licensing

- **Repository:** Apache License 2.0 (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE))
- **`vocabulary.yaml` itself:** CC0 — canonical terms should be freely adoptable by any system without license friction
- **Individual crosswalk files:** contributor's choice, provided the license permits Apache 2.0 downstream consumption. Declare the license in the crosswalk file header (`license:` field). Examples in merged crosswalks: Apache-2.0, MIT, MIT (code) + CC-BY-4.0 (specification).

## `domain_incubation` crosswalks

The `domain_incubation` `crosswalk_type` marks cross-system verb/domain
namespaces still in incubation. Validator skips strict `signal_types`
checks on these files (parallel to `rfc_category_reverse`), but the
following gates apply:

**Gate 1: Maintainer-only marker (reviewer-enforced).**
Only PRs from `aeoess` org maintainer accounts may set `crosswalk_type:
domain_incubation`. Reviewers reject non-maintainer PRs that attempt to
use the marker.

**Gate 2: Max 3 active files (validator-enforced).**
At most 3 files may carry `crosswalk_type: domain_incubation` at any
time. Validator counts and fails if exceeded.

**Gate 3: 90-day sunset (validator-enforced).**
Each `domain_incubation` file must carry a `verified_at: YYYY-MM-DD`
field at the top level. The file fails validation 90 days after
`verified_at`. Promotion to a standard `crosswalk_type` or deletion is
required before sunset.

**Required fields:**
- `crosswalk_type: domain_incubation`
- `verified_at: YYYY-MM-DD`
- `implementations:` (list with maintainer per verb)
- `promotion_criteria:` (explicit conditions for moving out of incubation)
