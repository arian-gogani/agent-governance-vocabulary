// check-bilateral-receipt-purpose-gate.js
// Executable regression contract for the bilateral_receipt purpose gate (#81,
// shipped in #139): the obligation to declare a registered `purpose` is keyed to
// MATCH STRENGTH, not to the act of mapping.
//
// Usage: node scripts/validators/check-bilateral-receipt-purpose-gate.js [data-root]
// Exit 0 = all cases behaved as contracted; exit 1 = any deviation.
//
// TWO ROOTS, AND THE DISTINCTION IS THE WHOLE POINT.
//   DATA_ROOT  supplied argument, or this checkout. Source of cases.json and of
//              the vocabulary.yaml whose enum the cases are graded against.
//   SELF_ROOT  always this checker's own checkout. Source of the
//              validate-crosswalks.js that is executed, and of node_modules.
//
// WIRED INTO THE TRUSTED CI JOB as of the commit that added the
// "bilateral_receipt purpose gate (trusted oracle)" step to
// .github/workflows/validate.yml. It landed one commit after this checker,
// deliberately: the trusted job checks out the BASE branch, so a commit that
// both introduced this file and invoked it from the base checkout would fail
// because the base did not contain it yet. The repository hit exactly that in
// 6d577d9 and solved it with a temporary existence guard, later removed in
// favour of failing loudly. Splitting the two avoided shipping a skip path that
// somebody then has to remember to delete.
//
// The trusted CI job checks out the base branch at `trusted/` and the pull
// request at `pr-data/`, then runs the BASE copy of this script against PR data.
//
// WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT BUY, stated exactly, because the obvious sentence
// is too strong. It means the CODE doing the grading (this checker and the
// validator it calls) is the base branch's, so a pull request cannot weaken the
// gate by editing the validator or this file in the same commit that changes
// the case data. It does NOT make the gate hostile-PR proof: `pull_request`
// workflows run the workflow definition from the pull request, so a hostile
// change could edit .github/workflows/validate.yml and drop this step
// altogether. Closing that requires making the workflow itself authoritative
// from outside the repository, through a required org or enterprise ruleset
// workflow, which is a governance change and not something this file can claim.
// `pull_request_target` is not adopted here. It is not unusable in principle,
// but making the workflow definition base-owned that way needs its own threat
// model: the trigger runs with elevated permissions, so it is only safe if the
// executable code stays base-owned and pull request bytes are handled strictly
// as data. Switching triggers without proving that is how privilege escalation
// happens.
//
// An earlier version of this checker resolved the validator from
// the supplied data root, which inverted that property exactly: the base-owned
// checker would have executed the PR-OWNED validator, handing the pull request
// the one thing the job exists to withhold. It also could not have worked, since
// `npm ci` runs only in `trusted/` and a validator executed from `pr-data/` has
// no node_modules.
//
// EXPECTED FAILURES PIN A DIAGNOSTIC CLASS, NEVER A BARE FAIL.
// The first version of this pack counted an expected-FAIL case as correct
// whenever ANY error mentioned the fixture file. Under mutation, deleting the
// exact/structural purpose requirement while adding an unrelated always-firing
// rule produced two green checkmarks over a gate that had been regressed. A
// regression test that passes for the wrong reason converts absence of coverage
// into a green signal. Each expected-FAIL case therefore names the class of
// diagnostic the validator must emit, and must emit no unexpected extra error.
//
// THE CONTRACT LIVES HERE, NOT IN fixtures/. A manifest under fixtures/ would be
// editable by the same pull request this job gates. Same reasoning as
// check-handoff-decay-fixtures.js.
